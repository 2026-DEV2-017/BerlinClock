## How to run project and tests

### Requirements
- `macOS 26.2`
- `Xcode 26.0.1` or later
(These are the versions I used, and the ones I'm expecting the project to work on)

### Steps to run
1. Clone/download repository
2. Open project in Xcode
3. Select choice of simulator (mine's iPhone 17)
4. Press `command-u` to run tests (tests can also be run individually by going to the test files)
5. Run the application (`command-r` or through Xcode's UI)
